 Techtrends Project
TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them with the wider community. In this project, I am taking the role of a platform engineer with the main role to package and deploy the application to a Kubernetes platform.

Wish me luck!
